# Dim Light
#### PLEASE PLAY FULL SCREEN :)

Dark Fantasy/Interactive Fiction made using Twine!
Life is bleak in Moribund. You live in the last city of the Old Empire. It stands alone. Ghouls make midnight raids against the surface. The Captain of Thorns struggles to defend the city amidst bleeding numbers while the Duke sits on a throne of decadence. But at least the city protects you from the terrors beyond the dimming light of civilization, the monsters outside the walls.

As raids increase and the guard grows small, someone has to delve into the dreaded
catacombs of the Old Empire, to put a stop to the tide of undead.
